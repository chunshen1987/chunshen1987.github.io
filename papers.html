                    <h3>Oct 2020: Recent development of hydrodynamic modeling in heavy-ion collisions</h3>
                    <p>Chun Shen and Li Yan</p>
                    <p>We present a concise review of the recent development of relativistic hydrodynamics
                       and its applications to heavy-ion collisions. Theoretical progress on the extended
                       formulation of hydrodynamics towards out-of-equilibrium systems is addressed,
                       emphasizing the so-called attractor solution. On the other hand, recent phenomenological
                       improvements in the hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions with respect to the
                       ongoing Beam Energy Scan program, the quantitative characterization of transport
                       coefficients in the three-dimensionally expanding quark-gluon plasma,
                       the fluid description of small colliding systems, and some other interdisciplinary
                       connections are discussed.

                    <p>JETSCAPE Collaboration</p>
                    <p>Using combined data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion and Large Hadron Colliders,
                       we constrain the shear and bulk viscosities of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at
                       temperatures of ∼150−350 MeV. We use Bayesian inference to translate experimental
                       and theoretical uncertainties into probabilistic constraints for the viscosities.
                       With Bayesian Model Averaging we account for the irreducible model ambiguities
                       in the transition from a fluid description of the QGP to hadronic transport
                       in the final evolution stage, providing the most reliable phenomenological
                       constraints to date on the QGP viscosities.

                    <p>We study photon production in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions
                       using a multistage model combining IP-Glasma, KøMPøST and relativistic hydrodynamics.

                       highlighting the role of the photon-hadron event-plane decorrelation.
                       We comment that this singular characteristic of early photons could be
                       used to provide dynamical information on the complex pre-hydrodynamics
                       phase of heavy-ion collisions.

                    <p>Wenbin Zhao, Chun Shen, Che Ming Ko, Quansheng Liu, Huichao Song</p>
                    <p>We study the collision energy dependence of (anti-)deuteron and (anti-)triton production
                    in the most central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = $7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV,
                    using the nucleon coalescence model. The needed phase-space distribution of nucleons at the
                    kinetic freeze-out is generated from a new 3D hybrid dynamical model (iEBE-MUSIC) by using a
                    smooth crossover equation of state (EoS) without a QCD critical point. Our model calculations
                    predict that the coalescence parameters of (anti-)deuteron ($B_2(d)$ and $B_2(\bar{d})$) decrease
                    monotonically as the collision energy increases, and the light nuclei yield ratio $N_t N_p/N_d^2$
                    remains approximately a constant with respect to the collision energy.
                    These calculated observables fail to reproduce the non-monotonic behavior of the corresponding
                    data from the STAR Collaboration. Without including any effects of the critical point in our model,
                    our results serve as the baseline predictions for the yields of light nuclei in the search for the
                    possible QCD critical points from the experimental beam energy scan of heavy ion collisions.

                    <p>Dmytro Oliinychenko, Chun Shen, Volker Koch</p>
                    <p>We study deuteron production using no-coalescence hydrodynamic + transport simulations of
                       central AuAu collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 7−200$ GeV. Deuterons are sampled thermally at the transition
                       from hydrodynamics to transport, and interact in transport dominantly via πpn <--> πd reactions.
                       The measured proton, Lambda, and deuteron transverse momentum spectra and yields are
                       reproduced well for all collision energies considered. We further provide a possible explanation
                       for the measured minimum in the energy dependence of the coalescence parameter, $B_2(\sqrt{s_{NN})$ as well
                       as for the difference between $B_2(d)$ for deuterons and that for anti-deuterons, $B_2(\bar{d})$.

                    <p>G. Giacalone, B. Schenke and C. Shen</p>
                    <p>We show that the correlation between the elliptic momentum anisotropy, $v_2$,
                       and the average transverse momentum, $[p_T]$, at fixed multiplicity in small
                       system nuclear collisions carries information on the origin of the observed
                       momentum anisotropy. A calculation using a hybrid IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD model
                       that includes contributions from final state response to the initial geometry
                       as well as initial state momentum anisotropies of the Color Glass Condensate,
                       predicts a characteristic sign change of the correlator $\hat{\rho}(v_2\{2\},[p_T])$
                       as a function of charged particle multiplicity in p+Au and d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV,
                       and p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. This sign change is absent in calculations without
                       initial state momentum anisotropies. The model further predicts a qualitative difference
                       between the centrality dependence of $\hat{\rho}(v_2\{2\},[p_T])$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV
                       and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV, with only the latter showing a sign change in peripheral events.
                       Predictions for O+O collisions at different collision energy show a similar behavior.
                       Experimental observation of these distinct qualitative features of $\hat{\rho}(v_2\{2\},[p_T])$ in small
                       and large systems would constitute strong evidence for the presence and importance of initial state momentum
                       anisotropies predicted by the Color Glass Condensate effective theory.

                    <p>We present calculations of bulk properties and multiparticle correlations in a large
                       variety of collision systems within a hybrid formalism consisting of IP-Glasma initial
                       conditions, MUSIC viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, and UrQMD microscopic hadronic transport.
                       In particular, we study heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
                       including Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, and O+O collisions, and Au+Au, U+U, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, and O+O collisions
                       at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We further study asymmetric systems,
                       including p+Au, d+Au, 3He+Au, and p+Pb collisions at various energies as well as p+p collisions
                       at 0.5 and 13 TeV. We describe experimental observables in all heavy ion systems well with
                       one fixed set of parameters, validating the energy and system dependence of the framework.
                       Many observables in the smaller systems are also well described, although they test the
                       limits of the model. Calculations of O+O collisions provide predictions for potential future runs at RHIC and LHC.

                    <h3>April 2020: Transverse momentum fluctuations and their correlation with elliptic flow in nuclear collision</h3>
                    <p>Björn Schenke, Chun Shen, Derek Teaney</p>
                    <p>We propose observables $v_0$ and $v_0(p_T)$ which quantify the relative fluctuations in the
                       total transverse momentum at fixed multiplicity. We first study the factorization of the fixed
                       multiplicity momentum dependent two particle correlation function into a product of $v_0(p_T^a)$ and $v_0(p_T^b)$
                       within realistic hydrodynamic simulations. Then we present computations of $v_0(p_T)$ for different particle types.
                       We determine the relation between the integrated $v_0$ and previously measured observables, and compare results
                       from a hybrid hydrodynamics based model to experimental data. The effects of bulk viscosity and an initial
                       pre-equilibrium stage on the results are quantified. We find that $v_0$ is strongly correlated with the initial
                       state entropy per elliptic area, $S/A$. Using this result, we explain how the observed correlations between
                       the elliptic flow and the transverse momentum (both in simulations and experiment) reflect the initial state
                       correlations between $1/A$ and ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ at fixed multiplicity.
                       We argue that the systematic experimental study of $v_0$, with the same sophistication as used for the other $v_n$,
                       can contribute significantly to our understanding of quark gluon plasma properties.

                    <h3>March 2020: A collision geometry-based 3D initial condition for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</h3>
                    <p>Chun Shen, Sahr Alzhrani</p>
                    <p>We present a simple way to construct 3D initial conditions for relativistic heavy-ion collisions
                       based on the Glauber collision geometry. Local energy and momentum conservation conditions are imposed
                       to set non-trivial constraints on our parameterizations of longitudinal profiles for the system's
                       initial energy density and flow velocity. After calibrating parameters with charged hadron rapidity
                       distributions in central Au+Au collisions, we test model predictions for particle rapidity distributions
                       in d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at Relativistic Heavy-Ion
                       Collider (RHIC). Simulations and comparisons with measurements are also made for Pb+Pb collisions at
                       Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies. We demonstrate that elliptic flow measurements in heavy-ion
                       collisions at $\sqrt{s} \sim 10$ GeV can set strong constraints on the dependence of Quark-Gluon Plasma
                       shear viscosity on temperature and net baryon chemical potential.
